1 Create a directory structure
 Note :   You are only allowed to use a single command and only one time
  we have to create a directory structure and store it in a text fileor directory name ="reboot.txt"
  
  example = mkdir -p a/{b/{g/k/reboot.txt,h/j/reboot.txt},c/{i/j/reboot.txt,j/l/reboot.txt},d/{f/l/reboot.txt,e/m/reboot.txt}}
  mkdir = command used to make directory in linux 
  -p = is for parent directory , any direcotory name written after is paresnt directory
      example =  mkdir -p abhijit/gehlot
        here abhijit is parent directory and gehlot is sub directory of abhijit or in other words gehlot names directory is saved in abhijit named directory
   "/" = it is used for sub directory of to form a directory in a directory 
     example =   mkdir d/g
       here g directory is formed inside d 
     
  
  
  2 Share and files and folder 

create two users name jack and Jill  from command line
create all the data under home directory of each users 
login with jack user and create a file name  jack.txt using vim editor and write "hello jack"
from jack user also create two directories name jack1 & jack2 
now login from Jill user and create a file. Jill.txt using vim editor and write "hey jiil"
from Jill also create two directoires named jill1 & jill2 

Important :  swap these files and directories in between users  and to swap don't use root account.
