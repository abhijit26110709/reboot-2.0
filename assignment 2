1 Create a directory structure
 Note :   You are only allowed to use a single command and only one time
  we have to create a directory structure and store it in a text fileor directory name ="reboot.txt"
  
  example = mkdir -p a/{b/{g/k/reboot.txt,h/j/reboot.txt},c/{i/j/reboot.txt,j/l/reboot.txt},d/{f/l/reboot.txt,e/m/reboot.txt}}
  mkdir = command used to make directory in linux 
  -p = is for parent directory , any direcotory name written after is paresnt directory
      example =  mkdir -p abhijit/gehlot
        here abhijit is parent directory and gehlot is sub directory of abhijit or in other words gehlot names directory is saved in abhijit named directory
   "/" = it is used for sub directory of to form a directory in a directory 
     example =   mkdir d/g
       here g directory is formed inside d 
     
  
  
  2 Share and files and folder 

  2.1 create two users name jack and Jill  from command line
    => useradd jack
    => useradd jill
     "useradd" =  this command is used to create a user in linux 
      or "adduser" can also be used , depends on which linux u are using!
     
  2.2 create all the data under home directory of each users
    => login into each user account 
    
  2.3 login with jack user and create a file name  jack.txt using vim editor and write "hello jack"
    => su jack 
     "su" = switch user is used to switch between different user in a linux machine 
    => vim jack.txt
     "vim" =  it is  a text editor used in linux . there are many teext editor like vi, nano.
     After entering jack.txt file press "I" to enter into insert mode , so u can type your message.
    => now type "hello jack"
     now press "esc" key to get out of insert mode 
    =>:wq! 
     it will save  the text written in file and exit the file and will bring you to terminal
     "q"  is used to exit editor without saving 
     "w" is used to save the changes 
  2.4 from jack user also create two directories name jack1 & jack2
    => mkdir jack1 jack2 
     two directories names "jack1" and "jack2" are created
  2.5 now login from Jill user and create a file. Jill.txt using vim editor and write "hey jiil"
    => su jill 
    => vim jill.txt
    => type "hey jill"
    => :wq!
    
  2.6 from Jill also create two directoires named jill1 & jill2 
    => mkdir jill1 and jill2
    two directories created names "jill1" and "jill2"
    
  2.7  swap these files and directories in between users  and to swap don't use root account.
     Open terminal and run following command
     =>cp -r /home/jack/{jack1,jack2,jack.txt} /tmp (Copying jack's data to tmp folder as /tmp directory is shared among all users)
     Now log out and login as jill
     Open terminal and run following command
     =>cp -r /tmp/{jack1,jack2,jack.txt} /home/jill (Copying from tmp folder to jill home directory)
     This will copy files of jack to jill user
     Now run the following command
     =>cp -r /home/jill/{jill1,jill2,jill.txt} /tmp (Copying jill's data to tmp folder as /tmp directory is shared among all users)
    Now log out and login as jack
    Open terminal and run following command
    =>cp -r /tmp/{jill1,jill2,jill.txt} /home/jack (Copying from tmp folder to jack home directory)
