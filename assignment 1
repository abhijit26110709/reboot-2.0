Play with directory: 
    1.1  create a directory without name from command line
           
           directory can be created by using "mkdir" command
           syntax or example = mkdir abhijit
           "abhijit" directory is created 
           
           
           if u have to create a direcoty without letters or name
           special characters or inverted comas can be used
           example = A) mkdir ' '
           ' ' directory is created 
           if u will type "ls" command with  other directories ' '  will also be shown
                     B) mkdir $
                     $ directory is created 
                     
    1.2  create a directory using name "-okgoogle"
           
           
         basic command for making directory is "mkdir"
         lets suppose we typed mkdir "-okgoogle"
         it will show " mkdir : invaid option -- "o" "
         kernel is considering -o of "-okgoogle" as a option of mkdir command
         to create "-okgoogle" directory we are gonna eliminate the position of mkdir options by placing "--"
         it will fill the position of option but it will not do anything 
         as soon as we will place this sign mkdir cmmand will not  consider -o of  "-okgoogle" as option 
         example =  mkdir -- "-okgoogle"
         it will create "-okgoogle " directory 
         
2 Block system call :
   2.1 block system call for date command
   
   
   2.2 block  system call for firefox
